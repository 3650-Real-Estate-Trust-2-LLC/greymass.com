* N-Q sources
** TODO Try training tesseract on sample images
*** Pro: would have reliable, historical data for large funds
*** Con: non-portable, requires user to train the same model, still have to validate data afterwards
** TODO Try Google vision API
*** Pro: highly reliable (99% accuracy on first try), fairly quick to parse
*** Con: needs an account (possibly paying)
** Clas structure on N-Q sources:
*** Funds have 1 or more series associated with them 
**** Can be found in the <SERIES-AND-CLASSES-CONTRACTS-DATA> tag in complete report txt
*** N-Q class should be composed of multiple series, and series should have the holdings
**** When generating the reports, format could be CIK_SERIESID_ACCEPTANCEDATE.txt
*** Holdings are grouped in TR tags, which could make them easier to generically parse
*** Will have to parse complete submission text for series data, then extract HTML from that for holdings

** Class Structure
*** Base class: Holding
